# VertebralEvolution
A collection of code used in my publications.

## Code from: Divergent evolutionary mechanisms underlie axial skeletal complexity across Crown Amniota

  Includes:
  1. Regions_analysis.R
  2. Heterogeneity_analysis.R
  3. Evolutuionary_modelling.R
  4. Ancestral_states.R
  
###  1. Regions_analysis
Code written to quantify the number and distribution of regions in a vertebral column.
3D geometric morphometric analysis of a vertebral column, given landmark coordinate data;
and for analysis of regionalization.
     
Modified for 3DGMM from Jones _et al_ 2018 following Head and Polly 2015.

  
###  3. Heterogeneity_analysis 
Code written to quantify of the total amount of morphological variation in a set of models;   
by taking the mean of the pairwise Procrustes distances.

Here for vertebral elements, but would work for quantifying morphological dispatiry in any data set.

  
###  4. Evolutuionary_modelling
Code written to test evolutionary models.

  
###  5. Ancestral_states
Code wriiten to model ancestral states, continuous and discrete;
and to plot data on a phylogeny.
