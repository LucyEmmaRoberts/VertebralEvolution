A collection of code used in my publications.

## Code and data from: Evolution of the reptile spine reveals independent trajectories to axial skeletal complexity in amniotes

  Includes:
  1. Regions_analysis.R
  2. Heterogeneity_analysis.R
  3. Evolutionary_modelling.R
  4. Ancestral_states.R
  5. Data/Landmarks.zip
  6. Data/Phylogeny.nex
  
###  1. Regions_analysis
Code written to quantify the number and distribution of regions in a vertebral column.
3D geometric morphometric analysis of a vertebral column, given landmark coordinate data;
and for analysis of regionalization.
     
Modified for 3DGMM from Jones _et al_ 2018 following Head and Polly 2015.

  
###  2. Heterogeneity_analysis 
Code written to quantify of the total amount of morphological variation in a set of models;   
by taking the mean of the pairwise Procrustes distances.

Here for vertebral elements, but would work for quantifying morphological dispatiry in any data set.

  
###  3. Evolutionary_modelling
Code written to test evolutionary models.

  
###  4. Ancestral_states
Code written to model ancestral states, continuous and discrete;
and to plot data on a phylogeny.

###  5. Data/Landmarks.zip
Landmark data collected for Evolution of the reptile spine reveals independent trajectories to axial skeletal complexity in amniotes

###  6. Data/Phylogeny.nex
Phylogeny used for evolutionary modelling and phylogenetic comparative methods for Evolution of the reptile spine reveals independent trajectories to axial skeletal complexity in amniotes


## Additional information: Code/Software

Code is all based in R.

This code was created and tested using R version 4.3.2 on a PC running Windows 10.

To use this code install R and any required packages listed within the code. Typical install for all packages should take <10 minutes.

All usage instructions are within the code as #comments. Demo using the data included here.
