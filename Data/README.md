# Data from: Evolution of the reptile spine reveals independent trajectories to axial skeletal complexity in amniotes

## Contents:

##### DATA

1\. Landmarks
3\. Dated phylogeny

### 1. Landmarks

3D coordinates for each specimen used to quantify regionalization and heterogeneity.
In TPS format. Collected using IDAV Landmark software.

### 2. Dated phylogeny

Time-calibrated phylogenetic supertree used in ancestral state reconstruction and evolutionary modelling.
Dated using *paleotree.*

## Description of the data and file structure

'Landmarks.zip' contains Landmark coordinate data in TPS formatted .txt files. Data for each specimen is in separate folders.
Nexus formatted phylogeny 'Phylogeny.nex'
